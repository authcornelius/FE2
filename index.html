        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h3>Become Proficient in React and TypeScript</h3>
                <p>I aim to deepen my understanding of React and TypeScript to build robust, scalable, and maintainable web applications. This involves mastering hooks, state management, and type-checking to prevent errors and improve code quality.</p>
                <p>By the end of the first year, I plan to complete several advanced courses and tutorials on React and TypeScript. I also aim to build at least three complex projects that demonstrate my ability to use these technologies effectively in a professional setting.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Build and Deploy Multiple Full-Stack Applications</h3>
                <p>I plan to develop several full-stack projects using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and React. These projects will help me understand the intricacies of backend development, RESTful APIs, and frontend-backend integration.</p>
                <p>In the first six months, my goal is to build a personal portfolio website that includes a blog, a contact form, and a project showcase. This will be hosted on a cloud platform and will utilize CI/CD pipelines for automated deployment.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Contribute to Open-Source Projects</h3>
                <p>Contributing to open-source projects is a great way to give back to the community, learn from other developers, and improve my coding skills. I aim to contribute to projects related to web development, documentation, and bug fixes.</p>
                <p>By the end of the second year, I plan to have made meaningful contributions to at least five different open-source projects. I will start by finding beginner-friendly issues to work on and gradually take on more challenging tasks.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Enhance My Understanding of Cloud Services like AWS and Azure</h3>
                <p>Cloud computing is essential for modern web applications. I plan to learn about various cloud services, including AWS and Azure, focusing on services like EC2, S3, Lambda, and Azure App Services. This knowledge will help me deploy and manage scalable applications.</p>
                <p>Throughout the next two years, I will earn certifications in AWS and Azure fundamentals. I will also build and deploy a serverless application using these cloud services, documenting the process and outcomes.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Get Certified in Frontend Development Technologies</h3>
                <p>To validate my skills and stay updated with industry standards, I aim to obtain certifications in frontend development technologies, such as React and TypeScript. These certifications will help me in my career growth and open new opportunities.</p>
                <p>My goal is to achieve at least two industry-recognized certifications in frontend development by the end of the second year. This will involve studying for and passing exams, and implementing knowledge gained from the certification process into my projects.</p>
